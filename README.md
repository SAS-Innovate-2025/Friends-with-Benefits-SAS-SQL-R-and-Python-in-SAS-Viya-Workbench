# Friends with Benefits: SAS® , SQL, R, and Python in SAS®  Viya Workbench  

This hands-on workshop shows learners how they can seamlessly switch from SAS® , SQL, R, and Python within a project – under the mantra of "use the right tool for the job".  Or, more simply put: use the tool you know. This activity follows a new policy analyst at the Department of Health and Human Services, who is tasked with understanding how the coronavirus, i.e., COVID19, impacted the labor supply of prime-aged women across the United States. Along that policy journey, you'll also gain exposure to SAS®  Viya Workbench, our latest-and-greatest coding environment!
